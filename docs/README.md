## Project Summary
Humans express emotions using different modalities. These modalities may include modalities such as facial expressions, vocal tone and the speech. Each person may express their emotions using different modalities in different proportions. In this work, we’ll try to propose an ensemble model that is based on reinforcement learning, that is capable of capturing the user specific weight of each modality in the expressions made by each user in predicting the emotional status.

The proposed reinforcement learning model may learn iteratively from the users’ actual feedback to adjust the weights of the modalities. The proposed approach may be compared with standard ensemble models. If it performs better than standard generalized ensemble models, it may justify using personalized reinforcement learning models to capture the personal variations in the modalities of expression.
